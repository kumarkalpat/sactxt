Revised Prompt 1: To Generate a Complete Book (Single-Line Verses)
This version adds a crucial instruction to format each part of the verse as a single-line string, using a | character to denote poetic line breaks instead of a newline.

You are an expert in Hindu philosophy and an assistant skilled at generating structured JSON data. Your task is to create a complete JSON object for the "Isha Upanishad".

The JSON object must strictly follow this structure:
- A root object with `id`, `title`, `author`, `introduction`, and a `chapters` array.
- The `id` should be a lowercase, kebab-case string (e.g., "isha-upanishad").
- The `author` is "Unknown (Vedic sages)".
- The `introduction` should be a concise, 2-3 paragraph summary of the text's core teachings.
- The `chapters` array will contain a single chapter object.
- The chapter object must have `chapter_number`, `name`, `summary`, `verses_count`, and a `verses` array.
- The `verses` array must contain objects for all 18 verses.
- Each verse object must include:
  - `id`: A unique string formatted as `isha-1-[verse_number]`.
  - `verse_number`: The sequential number of the verse.
  - `original`: The full verse text in Devanagari script.
  - `transliteration`: An accurate IAST transliteration.
  - `translations`: An object containing translations for `english` and `hindi`.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** For the `original`, `transliteration`, and all `translations` fields, the entire text for a verse must be a **single-line JSON string**. Do not use newline characters (`\n`). If the original verse has distinct poetic lines, separate them with a single pipe character surrounded by spaces (` | `).
Revised Prompt 2: To Generate a Single Chapter (Single-Line Verses)
This variation applies the same single-line constraint to the chapter-specific prompt.

You are an expert in sacred Hindu texts and an assistant skilled at generating structured JSON data. Your task is to create a JSON object for Chapter 2 of the "Katha Upanishad", titled "The Path of the Good vs. the Pleasant".

The JSON object must strictly represent a single chapter with the following structure:
- A root object with `chapter_number`, `name`, `summary`, `verses_count`, and a `verses` array.
- The `verses` array must contain objects for all verses in Chapter 2.
- Each verse object must include:
  - `id`: A unique string formatted as `katha-2-[verse_number]`.
  - `verse_number`: The sequential number of the verse.
  - `original`: The full verse text in Devanagari.
  - `transliteration`: An accurate IAST transliteration.
  - `translations`: An object containing high-quality translations for `english` and `hindi`.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** For the `original`, `transliteration`, and all `translations` fields, the entire text for a verse must be a **single-line JSON string**. Do not use newline characters (`\n`). If the original verse has distinct poetic lines, separate them with a single pipe character surrounded by spaces (` | `).
By adding this explicit constraint, you ensure the generated JSON is clean and predictable, giving you full control over how and where line breaks are rendered in your application's UI.
