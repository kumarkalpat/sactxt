1. JSON Data Structure
Each sacred text is defined by a JSON file. The structure must match the example below to be compatible with the application.

{
  "id": "unique-text-id",
  "title": "Title of the Text",
  "author": "Author of the Text",
  "introduction": "A multi-line introduction...",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapter_number": 1,
      "name": "Chapter Name",
      "summary": "Chapter summary...",
      "verses_count": 1,
      "verses": [
        {
          "id": "unique-text-id-1-1",
          "verse_number": 1,
          "original": "Original text in Devanagari...",
          "transliteration": "IAST transliteration...",
          "translations": {
            "english": "English translation..."
          }
        }
      ],
      "audioUrl": "https://archive.org/details/your-audio-id (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
2. Example AI Prompt
You can use a generative AI like Gemini to create the JSON content for you. Provide a clear and specific prompt, including the required structure. Here is a simple example:

Generate a complete JSON object for the sacred text 'Hanuman Chalisa'.

The JSON must follow this structure exactly:
- A root object with "id", "title", "author", and "introduction".
- A "chapters" array containing chapter objects.
- Each chapter object must have "chapter_number", "name", "summary", "verses_count", and a "verses" array.
- Each verse in the "verses" array must have "id", "verse_number", "original" (in Devanagari), "transliteration" (IAST), and a "translations" object with an "english" key.

Please generate the content for all 42 verses of the Hanuman Chalisa.
3. Adding Your Text
To add your text to the library, follow these steps:

Create your text's .json file using the structure and prompt guide above.
Upload the file to the data/ folder in the source repository.
Add an entry for your new text in the data/texts.json manifest file. This entry tells the app where to find your file. It should look like this:
{
  "id": "your-unique-text-id",
  "title": "Your Text Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "path": "data/your-file-name.json"
}
